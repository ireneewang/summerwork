I learned about the basics of functions in R and the manipulation of them through the use of the `uniroot()` function by implementing science functions from classes in school.

#### ***Part 3: Apple Report*** 
[HTML](RMarkdown/applereport.md), [Program](RMarkdown/applereport.Rmd): 
Through Excel files and plots on R, I produced copies of Apple's gross profit and annual income and the reasons behind the trends. I learned how to clean up data in R and how to plot graphs.

#### ***Part 4: Playing Cards***
[HTML](RMarkdown/playingcards.md), [Program](RMarkdown/playingcards.Rmd): 
I made a deck of cards on R and manipulated them in accordance to whichever game is being played, simulating the shuffling and dealing of cards. I learned about matrices, arrays, and data frames, logical operators, and the use of environment in R.

#### ***Part 5: Slot Machine***
[HTML](RMarkdown/slotmachine.md), [Program](RMarkdown/slotmachine.Rmd):
I made a slot machine that can operate and determine prize value. I learned if, else, and else if functions, how to creatively implement simple functions for a more complicated task, attributes, vectorized code, and loops.

#### ***Part 6: Apple Statistics***
[HTML](RMarkdown/applestatistics.md), [Program](RMarkdown/applestatistics.Rmd):
I learned how to use ggplot to graph aeshetically pleasing plots of the Apple data and analyzed the trends using my knowledge of statistics.

#### ***Part 7: Apple Presentation***
[HTML](RMarkdown/applepresentation.md), [Program](RMarkdown/applepresentation.Rmd):
I learned how to use the officer package in order to produce powerpoint presentations in R.

#### ***Part 8: Data Collection***
[HTML](RMarkdown/datacollection.md), [Program](RMarkdown/datacollection.Rmd):
I learned how to use the BatchGetSymbols package and ggplot facet to download and analyze data in R.

#### ***Part 9: Final Presentation***
[R Google Slides Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19QzHweKEYZcfiyyd6kMPryq96DQQy1iu_Si0NWtOQ_k/edit?usp=sharing):
I gave a final presentation on my internship, compiling everything into a Google slideshow. Everything in this repository is condensed and reflected in it. This is supposed to act as a tutorial for those who have never used R before.

#### ***Part 10: Research Paper***
[HTML](RMarkdown/researchpaper.md), [Program](RMarkdown/researchpaper.Rmd):
I applied my internship experience to a research opportunity involving prostate cancer research by retrieving, analyzing, and plotting public data.
