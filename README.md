## Summer Work
### Irene Wang
#### This is my project/any work that took place over the summer of 2020 as an intern, and I'm utilizing GitHub as a way to track and demonstrate by progress. Everything is virtually self taught.

first.R: My first script starts with 3 simple functions. First, I simulated the rolling of a pair of dice and the computation of their sum by writing a function dubbed `roll()`. This was executed using `sample()`. The next two functions essentially follow the same format. I took equations from my science classes in school and wrote them as functions. The gist of these two functions is that given the input values, it can calculate the result by following the given equation.
