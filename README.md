## Summer Work

### Irene Wang

This is my project/any work that took place over the summer of 2020 as an intern, and I'm utilizing GitHub as a way to track and demonstrate by progress. Everything is virtually self taught.
Starting date: 7/1/20
Ending date: TBD

## **Table of Contents**

#### ***Part 1: Dice Roll*** 
[HTML](RMarkdown/diceroll.md), [Program](RMarkdown/diceroll.Rmd): 
This details my work on simulating the rolling of dice and an investigation on the fairness of a single die. I learned how different functions and their uses, how to simulate repeated trials, and how to implement statistical tests in R. 

#### ***Part 2: R Functions*** 
[HTML](RMarkdown/rfunctions.md), [Program](RMarkdown/rfunctions.Rmd): 
I learned about the basics of functions in R and the manipulation of them through the use of the `uniroot()` function by implementing science functions from classes in school.

#### ***Part 3: Apple Report*** 
[HTML](RMarkdown/applereport.md), [Program](RMarkdown/applereport.Rmd): 
Through Excel files and plots on R, I produced copies of Apple's gross profit and annual income and the reasons behind the trends. I learned how to clean up data in R and how to plot graphs.

#### ***Part 4: Playing Cards***
[HTML](RMarkdown/playingcards.md), [Program](RMarkdown/playingcards.Rmd): 
I made a deck of cards on R and manipulated them in accordance to whichever game is being played, simulating the shuffling and dealing of cards. I learned about matrices, arrays, and data frames, logical operators, and the use of environment in R.

#### ***Part 5: Slot Machine***
[HTML](RMarkdown/slotmachine.md), [Program](RMarkdown/slotmachine.Rmd):
I made a slot machine that can operate and determine prize value. I learned if, else, and else if functions, how to creatively implement simple functions for a more complicated task, attributes, vectorized code, and loops.
