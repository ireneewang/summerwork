## First

[**8/7/20:datacollection1.R**](../R/datacollection1.R): I used the BatchGetSymbols package to collect data from Apple and Walmart from the past 15 years and then Facebook for the past 10. I did this by setting a starting date, end date, and tickers that told the package to collect the data from the yahoo database.
```{r datacollection1}
source("../R/datacollection1.R")
```

Apple and Walmart experienced exponential growth while Facebook's seems more linear, though still irregular. In the past year, Facebook experienced very steep, linear growth.
