## First

[**8/6/20:applepresentation.R**](../R/applepresentation.R): I used the officer package in R to produce a ppt. Functions like `add_slide()` and `ph_with()` assisted in creating slides and adding content.
```{r applepresentation}
source("../R/applepresentation.R")
print(apple_pres, target = "../apple_pres.pptx")
```
