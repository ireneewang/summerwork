## First

**7/10/20:appleincome.R**: I downloaded an excel file on Apple's income statement from 2005 - present time from https://advisortools.zacks.com/Research/Stocks/AAPL/Financials, and edited it on excel by flipping columns and rows. I then uploaded it as a .csv file into R, where I cleaned up the chart by removing the commas from the numbers in order to make the data numeric and removed any N/A lines. I then used the `plot()` and `ggplot()` functions to produced graphs on Apple's total revenue and gross profit.

```{r appleplot}
source("../R/appleincome.R")
plot(x=income2$Fiscal.period, y = income2$Total.Revenues, type = "b")
plot(x=income2$Fiscal.period, y = income2$Total.Revenues, type = "h")
